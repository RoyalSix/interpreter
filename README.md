# Custom Interpreter
This is a interpreter very simliar to C++
Only contains the essiential functions, such as if, else, while.
To print instead of "cout << 'Hello World';" use "display 'Hello World';"

Includes a few simple test files, can import them into project folder for checking of Interpreter performance.
